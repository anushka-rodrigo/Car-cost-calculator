# Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator – version 1

## 📌 Overview
Purchasing a vehicle is one of the largest financial decisions an individual can make. In economies such as Sri Lanka’s—where fuel price volatility, import taxes, depreciation, and maintenance costs significantly impact ownership—making a **data-driven decision** is essential.

This repository contains **version 1, a console-based application** developed to support an academic research project that constructs a **mathematical model** for analyzing the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** of vehicles. The application evaluates vehicle ownership costs over a defined period by systematically incorporating purchase price, depreciation, maintenance, operating, service, and ancillary costs. This is a basic console application.

The tool is designed to convert subjective vehicle purchasing decisions into **objective, quantifiable economic comparisons**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Application
The console application was built to:

- Implement the mathematical cost model described in the research
- Perform consistent and repeatable cost calculations
- Compare multiple vehicles under identical economic and usage assumptions
- Support evidence-based vehicle selection for cost efficiency

This version focuses **only on calculations** and validation of the model logic.  
Future versions will include a **front-end UI and enhanced technology stack**.

---

## 🧮 Cost Components Considered
The application calculates and aggregates the following cost categories:

- **Initial Purchase Cost**
- **Depreciation**
  - Reducing balance depreciation method
- **Maintenance Costs**
  - Tyres, brake pads, fluids, and wear-based replacements
- **Operating Costs**
  - Fuel consumption
  - Insurance
- **Service Costs**
  - Periodic servicing
  - Emissions testing
- **Ancillary Costs**
  - Vehicle washing
  - Miscellaneous expenses (percentage-based)
- **Residual Value**
  - Estimated resale value after ownership period

All vehicles are evaluated under the **same assumptions** to ensure fairness and objectivity.

## 📊 Case Study Context
The model is demonstrated using a real-world scenario:

- Ownership duration: **3 years**
- Distance traveled: **~55,000 km**
- Lease amount: **Rs. 2,000,000**
- Budget: **Rs. 5,000,000**
- Vehicles compared: **8 second-hand vehicles**
  - Manufactured years: 1999–2017
  - Engine capacities: 660cc–2498cc
  - Fuel types: Petrol & Diesel
  - Transmissions: Manual & Automatic

The selected vehicles represent a realistic cross-section of the Sri Lankan second-hand vehicle market.

---

## ⚙️ Assumptions Used in Calculations
- Fuel prices remain constant over the 3-year period
- All wear components are brand new at purchase
- Monthly travel distance is consistent
- Lease payments are excluded during ownership period
- Vehicles are purchased with the intent to resell
- Maximum ownership lifespan capped at 10 years

These assumptions are aligned with the academic research and can be modified in future versions.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
In **version 2**, the application will be rebuilt using a **different technology stack** and will include a **front-end UI** to make the tool more user-friendly and interactive. This version will also allow easier data input and improved visualization of cost breakdowns.

---

## 📚 Research Background
This application supports an academic study focused on:

- Mathematical modeling of real-world economic decisions
- Cost optimization in vehicle ownership
- Decision-making under economic uncertainty

The framework is **replicable and adaptable** for different countries, time periods, and market conditions by adjusting model parameters.
